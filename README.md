# Tailwind and Bit

This repo contains a number of helper components and example implementations for creating Tailwind-styled components with Bit

1. The `tailwind-config` env demonstrates creating a component out of your tailwind config and exposing this config so that it is consumable in either your own applications or a bit env for rendering your tailwind-styled bit components.
1. The `env-with-tailwind` environment is an environment pre-configured with tailwind support. You can also create this env using the [tailwind env template](https://bit.dev/bit-foundations/styling/templates/styling-templates)
1. A sample UI component, tw-button, using the above env and demonstrating how tailwind styles and configs are rendered when your env is configured for tailwind.
