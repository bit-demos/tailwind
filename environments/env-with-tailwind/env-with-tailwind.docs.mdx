## Overview

A customized react environment, with tailwind support added via a webpack config component.

### Usage instructions

Under the **variant** section of your `workspace.json` file choose which components you want to have the custom environment set. You can find the id of the extension in the `env-with-tailwind.aspect.ts` file.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/**}, {pages/**}": {
      "learn-bit-react.ui-library-wrappers/tailwind/environments/env-with-tailwind": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime Configurations

The tailwind configuration has been added to this env's webpack config via the [template webpack transformer component](https://bit.dev/bit-foundations/styling/tailwind/webpack-transformer). This component returns a pair of transformers
that configure webpack for `tailwind` support.

## Preview Configurations

Tailwind styles have been added to the `.preview.runtime.ts` file in order to simulate the styles configuration from a consuming app in component compositions.
