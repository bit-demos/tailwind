# Overview

This Tailwind config component contains both tailwind.config.js and style.css files, for fully defining and configuring tailwind for your project.

These configs can then be used in conjunction with a bit environment, for development of tailwind-styled components using bit's full feature set, or as a standalone - and standardised - configuration to be 
used in app-level tailwind configs across the organisation.

Indeed it is intended to be used for both - with your bit components therefore using the same config as you would in your app and fully reflecting how your tailwind styles will render
when consumed. You can of course use a different tailwind config in your apps depending on the look-and-feel you want where you use your components.

## Configuring Tailwind For Bit

This config contains a basic configuration for using tailwind3 with Bit. Specifically, as opposed to a standard tailwind config, here we are trying to produce
as generic a config for the `content` field as possible in order to 'capture' the tailwind styles in your components' files, whatever component you are developing. 
However, too lax a glob pattern will dramatically reduce performance of your dev server and build pipeline, and potentially include files which tailwind's parser will unintentionally 
attempt to parse.  

To get round this, we've configured two mid-fixes, `.tw.` and `.tailwind.` - along with composition files - to denote files that contain tailwind styles. 

You can of course define your own capture patterns for telling tailwind where to find styles, but please keep the above advisories in mind when doing so.

## Use in a Bit env

To configure Tailwind for a Bit env, you must apply a config to the env's postCss webpack config, which will run the Tailwind post-processor on components using that env.

This can be done via this [`transformers` component](https://bit.cloud/bit-foundations/styling/tailwind/webpack-transformer), which takes in a path to a tailwind.config.js file 
and implements the required webpack transform to add Tailwind with postCss. 

After configuring the tailwind config, you then just need to import the styles.css file from this component into the env's `preview.runtime` file, like you would to any tailwind-ready app, 
in order to make the required tailwind styles available to components using that env. 

## Usage 

### In a Bit env
``` js
import { tailwindConfigPath } from '@learn-bit-react/ui-library-wrappers.tailwind.configs.tailwind-config';

const { 
    previewConfigTransformer: twPreviewTransformer, 
    devServerConfigTransformer: twDevServerTransformer 
} = UseTailwindTransformer(tailwindConfigPath);
```

See the `env-with-tailwind` env in this scope for an example of how this is done.


### In any tailwind-ready app

You can use, and compose upon, the tailwind config in any app by adding the following to the tailwind.config.js file in your app:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
import { tailwindConfig } from '@learn-bit-react/ui-library-wrappers.tailwind.configs.tailwind-config';

module.exports = {
  ...tailwindConfig
}
```
